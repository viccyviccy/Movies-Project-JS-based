Was created during the work at 'Go IT | Upscale Academy' as a group project of five people. 
The original first repository was published at https://github.com/RomanGruba/prj_ooorv, as Roman was the team lead for the project. 
My part was to create header with the menu part (mobile-first). During the creation I used JavaScript, Webpack, SCSS, loader plugin.
